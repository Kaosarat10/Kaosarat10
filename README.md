# Hi there, I'm Kaosarat!

Iâ€™m a Business Analyst who helps businesses get clear on their goals and align the right people, strategies, and processes to make those goals a reality. With a solid background in data analysis and business strategy, I turn complex problems into simple, actionable solutions.


 **I don't just analyze dataâ€”I bridge business goals with data solutions**.

###  What I Do

I work closely with teams to define goals, uncover whatâ€™s holding them back, and align the right people, strategies, and processes to move forward. 
I break down real business problems and map out practical solutions that actually get implemented.

Whether itâ€™s turning a rough idea into a fully launched solution or making sure stakeholders stay aligned, I bring structure to uncertainty and help teams stay focused on what truly matters.
