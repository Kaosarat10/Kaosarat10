# Hi there, 

I’m Kaosarat, a business analyst and strategy partner. I help businesses move from confusion to clarity: whether it’s launching something new, fixing inefficiencies, or building better systems that actually work.

Many businesses don’t fail because the idea is bad. They struggle because the structure is missing.
That’s where I come in.
I help businesses get clear on their goals and align the right people, strategies, and processes to make those goals a reality. With a solid background in data analysis and business strategy, I turn complex problems into simple, actionable solutions.


 **I bring clarity, structure, and strategy to every business challenge**.

###  What I Do

I work closely with teams to define goals, uncover what’s holding them back, and align the right people, strategies, and processes to move forward. 
I break down real business problems and map out practical solutions that actually get implemented.

Whether it’s turning a rough idea into a fully launched solution or making sure stakeholders stay aligned, I bring structure to uncertainty and help teams stay focused on what truly matters.

### My Approach
